What is this?
-------------

This is the code that runs just about everything at Ftrain.com (soon to relaunch). It contains these django apps:

- kcal -- diet and exercise blog
- reviews -- small reviews of small things
- features -- a blog to study the culture of software
- dotcom -- a blog to handle "legacy" ftrain.com stuff
- ads -- a fake ad server

There are a number of dependencies & nothing here is ready for launch. It's here in the spirit of cutting-and-pasting, and sharing. Maybe someone else wants to play around.

TODO
----
- Everything
- Document everything
- List dependencies
- Comment code
- Fix a ton of bugs
- Finish LeastReview and Featurism codebase
- Get rid of Paul-centric variables &c.
- Fix RSS
- Make Haystack an option rather than the only way to display things
- Get caching fixed
- Make it possible to launch from the command line with a working django
- Separate out apps and release as individual projects (I.e. setup.py
  and post to PyPI)
