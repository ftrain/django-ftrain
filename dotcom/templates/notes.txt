              <p class="first">I decided in July of 2009 to reconfigure certain parts of my existence. I had many projects underway but few of them were close to finished. I was spending hours listening to old radio programs and thinking about the way technology influences popular culture but I was incapable of externalizing my ideas, of discussing them or writing them down. I was becoming ever more paranoid, and fearful of strangers. My wife was out of work and I felt trapped by that. I weighed approximately 370 pounds and was on cholesterol and heart medications. The riverbed was dry but still I was wading.</p>

              <p>In response I became a kind of willing cyborg. I built a note-taking system. I lost 70 pounds with many more to go. Noting the pleasure I found in writing through the very boring work of losing weight I decided to build other systems to manage my other obsessions as they relate to entertainment, form, and prose. I can do much more now. The code is <a href="/dotcom/code">open-sourced</a> if you want it. Not packaged up yet, though.</p>

              <p>I have been here writing for 12 years. Preparing to re-launch I read through my prose. I thought it would be painful, and sometimes it was. But then I'd find something I'd forgotten entirely, like [this piece about outsourcing](TheWorkers).</p>

              <p>I can see myself waiting for adults to show up and either take away the web or reward me in some way. Waiting for the approval of adults. Somewhere in there I became one of them, of the adults. But I would like to come back and be here for a while. Why bother? Why give it away? I have learned that the things I love will eat me alive if I do not give them away. I have much to learn.</p>

<p>Love should be easy; work should be hard.</p>

            <p>Not long before I realized that this Mr. Bowkett's prose--<i>and if you look at his presentations</i> you'll see the same--shows a powerful influence from presentation ethos. Entertain and illustrate. It is filled with cognitive enrichment. Yegge's rhetorical approach is similar. They are presenting.</b> This is not a <i>criticism; just an observation</i>. In fact I think it's a natural offshoot of another phenomenon I've observed--that of defensive prose.</p>

            <p>Computers are faking it.</p>

            <p>Layers of abstraction and replace that with "consensus."</p>

            <p>We've standardized consensus in the standards process. Standards are a kind of sovereign territory.</p>

            <p>This is.</p>

            <p><i>Layers of Consensus</i></p>

            <p>Middle-class.</p>

            <p>Post-consumer communities.</p>

            <p>Counterculture; computing.</p>
