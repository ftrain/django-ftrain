What is this?
-------------

This is the code that runs Ftrain.com. Actually, at this writing it _will_ run Ftrain.com, likely starting in February 2010. Right now I'm just getting things rolling so I can learn how Github works and thing about what's involved in sharing code.

The code will most likely be useful for cutting-and-pasting, as it's rather specific to my purposes. That said, maybe someone else wants to play around with it, so here it is. OHLIH in particular might be handy for folks.

TODO
----
- Document everything
- List dependencies
- Comment code

- Finish LeastReview and Featurism codebase
- Get rid of Paul-centric variables &c.
